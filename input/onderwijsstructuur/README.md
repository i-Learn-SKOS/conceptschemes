# Onderderwijsstructuur

> This is about the i-Learn local onderwijsstructuur used in v1 of the SKOS-API only.

## Intro

The "onderwijsstructuur" is the replacement of the former "onderwijsniveaus" in earlier versions of this project.

The input is a Turtle file shopped from https://github.com/i-Learn-SKOS/common-conceptschemes and put as is in the /schemes directory of this project.

Any conversion information concerning this replacement is found in directory `conversion/local-ondniv-to-common-onderwijsstructuur`.

Any information we add to the common onderwijsstructuur conceptscheme for usage in our project, is found here in `file ostr-additions.xlsx`.
